Currently, they have to manually export data from the dashboard and create reports in Excel.\n\nRequired features:\n• Scheduled PDF/Excel report generation\n• Custom report templates\n• Email delivery to stakeholders\n• Historical trend analysis\n• Compliance-specific metrics (uptime, security events, etc.)\n\nThis would save our team several hours per month. Is this something we could add to the roadmap?",
