    "content": "Hi team,\n\nI've been using your network monitoring tool for the past month, and I've noticed that the dashboard takes 15-20 seconds to load each time I refresh it. This is making it very difficult to monitor our network in real-time. We're a small business with about 50 devices, and this performance issue is really impacting our productivity.\n\nCould you please look into this? We're running the latest version (2.3.1) on a dedicated server with 16GB RAM.\n\nThanks,\nSarah Johnson\nIT Manager, TechStart Solutions",

    "content": "Hello PlexNet team,\n\nI just wanted to say how much I love the new VPN kill switch feature you added in the latest update. It's exactly what I needed for my work-from-home setup. The interface is intuitive and the performance is excellent. Keep up the great work!\n\nOne small suggestion: it would be nice to have a way to create custom VPN profiles for different networks (work vs personal).\n\nBest regards,\nMike Chen\nNetwork Engineer",

API documentation examples are incomplete for authentication flows\n4. Mobile app setup instructions are outdated\n\nWe're a university network team managing 500+ access points and good documentation is crucial for our deployment.\n\nI've attached some screenshots of confusing sections if that helps.\n\nThanks for the great product!\nAlex Thompson\nNetwork Administrator\nWestfield University",
