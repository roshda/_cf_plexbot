    "content": "When trying to run PlexNet in a Docker container on ARM64 systems (Apple Silicon Macs, Raspberry Pi, etc.), the container fails to start with the following error:\n\n```\nstandard_init_linux.go:228: exec user process caused: exec format error\ndocker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed\n```\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Pull the latest Docker image\n2. Run on ARM64 system\n3. Container exits immediately with exec format error\n\nExpected: Container should run on ARM64 systems\nActual: Container fails to start\n\nThis is blocking deployment on modern Apple Silicon Macs and ARM-based servers, which are becoming increasingly common.\n\nSystem info:\n- Docker version: 24.0.6\n- Host OS: macOS Sonoma 14.1 (Apple Silicon)\n- Image: plexnet/monitoring:latest\n\nPlease provide ARM64 builds or multi-arch support.",

Currently, we have to use custom exporters or scrape PlexNet's REST API, which is inefficient.\n\nRequested metrics:\n- Device status (up/down)\n- Bandwidth utilization per interface\n- Error rates and packet loss\n- CPU/memory usage of monitored devices\n- Custom alerts as Prometheus alerts\n\nThis would allow seamless integration with existing Prometheus-based monitoring setups.\n\nTechnical details:\n- Expose metrics on `/metrics` endpoint\n- Support Prometheus exposition format\n- Include appropriate labels for device identification\n- Configurable metrics collection interval",
