    "title": "Kernel panic when enabling packet capture on high-traffic interfaces",
    "content": "System experiences kernel panic when attempting to enable packet capture on 40Gbps interfaces with sustained traffic >30Gbps.\n\n## Environment\n- PlexNet Version: 2.3.1\n- OS: Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS (Kernel 5.15.0-89-generic)\n- Hardware: Dell PowerEdge R750 (Intel Xeon Gold 6338, 256GB RAM)\n- Network Interfaces: Mellanox ConnectX-6 100Gbps (4 ports)\n- Traffic Load: 35-45 Gbps sustained\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Configure packet capture on interface `ens1f0` (40Gbps link)\n2. Set capture filter: `tcp port 443`\n3. Start capture with buffer size 1GB\n4. System becomes unresponsive within 30-60 seconds\n5. Kernel panic: `BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffc0000000`\n\n## Expected Behavior\nPacket capture should work without system instability, even on high-speed interfaces.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nSystem crashes with kernel panic. Capture works fine on 1Gbps and 10Gbps interfaces.\n\n## Logs\n```\n[  234.567890] PlexNet Capture: Starting packet capture on ens1f0\n[  245.123456] kernel: [Hardware Error]: Machine check events logged\n[  256.789012] Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt\n[  256.789013] CPU: 12 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/12 Tainted: G           OE     5.15.0-89-generic\n```\n\n## Workaround\nNone available. Have to avoid packet capture on high-speed interfaces.\n\n## Impact\nCritical - Prevents network troubleshooting on backbone links.

    "content": "SNMP poller process exhibits memory leak, causing gradual performance degradation over time. Memory usage increases by approximately 50MB per hour under normal load.\n\n## Environment\n- PlexNet Version: 2.3.0\n- OS: CentOS 7.9.2009\n- Hardware: VMware VM (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM)\n- SNMP Devices: 450 Cisco switches and routers\n- Polling Interval: 60 seconds\n\n## Symptoms\n- Memory usage starts at ~2GB, grows to 8GB+ over 24 hours\n- SNMP polling response time increases from 0.5s to 5s+\n- System becomes unresponsive, requires restart\n- No memory is freed during garbage collection cycles\n\n## Investigation\nUsing `valgrind` and heap profiling, identified memory leak in SNMP session management:\n- SNMP session objects not being properly closed\n- OID cache growing indefinitely\n- Prepared statements accumulating in connection pool\n\n## Code Location\nIssue appears to be in `/src/snmp/poller.go` around line 234:\n```go\nsession, err := snmp.NewSession(target)\n// session.Close() not called in error paths\n```\n\n## Impact\nHigh - Requires daily service restarts in production environment. Affects monitoring reliability for enterprise network with 450 devices.\n\n## Temporary Fix\nRestart PlexNet service daily at 2 AM to prevent memory exhaustion.\n\n## Requested Fix\nImplement proper SNMP session cleanup and add connection pool limits.",

    "title": "SSL certificate validation bypass in webhook delivery",
    "content": "Webhook delivery system does not properly validate SSL certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks when delivering alerts to HTTPS endpoints.\n\n## Security Impact\n- **CVSS Score**: 7.4 (High)\n- **Attack Vector**: Network\n- **Confidentiality Impact**: High\n- **Integrity Impact**: High\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe webhook client uses an HTTP client that disables SSL certificate verification:\n```go\ntr := &http.Transport{\n    TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true},\n}\n```\n\nThis affects all webhook deliveries to HTTPS URLs, potentially allowing attackers to:\n1. Intercept alert notifications\n2. Modify alert contents\n3. Redirect alerts to malicious endpoints\n\n## Affected Components\n- Webhook delivery service\n- Alert notification system\n- Integration endpoints (Slack, Teams, custom HTTPS webhooks)\n\n## Reproduction\n1. Set up webhook endpoint with self-signed certificate\n2. Configure PlexNet to send alerts to this endpoint\n3. Use mitmproxy or similar tool to intercept traffic\n4. Observe that SSL certificate validation is bypassed\n\n## Remediation\n- Remove `InsecureSkipVerify: true` from TLS configuration\n- Implement proper certificate validation\n- Add option for custom CA certificates\n- Add certificate pinning for known endpoints\n\n## Timeline\n- Vulnerability discovered: 2024-11-15\n- Reported to vendor: 2024-11-20\n- Vendor acknowledged: 2024-11-25\n- Fix expected: TBD\n\n## Impact\nAll customers using HTTPS webhooks are affected. Enterprise customers with sensitive network alerts should disable webhook functionality until patched.",
