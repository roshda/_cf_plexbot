I can't find the device list anymore, and the search function doesn't work the way it used to.\n\nWhat I was trying to do: Find all switches in building A\nWhat happened: Got lost in the new interface, took me 10 minutes to find what I needed\nWhat I expected: Quick access to device filtering like before\n\nPlease either bring back the old layout or make the new one more intuitive. The current design feels like it was made for developers, not network administrators.",

The customizable notifications and smart grouping really help me stay on top of network issues without getting overwhelmed.\n\nThe mobile push notifications are a game-changer for on-call duties. Being able to acknowledge alerts directly from my phone saves so much time.\n\nOne small suggestion: Could you add more granular control over which alerts trigger mobile notifications? I'd love to get notified for critical issues but not for informational alerts.",
